This module contains everything needed to run a vegetation model
in standalone mode.
The vegetation model is assumed to have a set of prognostic `Y` and
auxiliary `p` variables, which describe the state of the
vegetation system. The system is evolved in time by solving
equations of the form
```
\frac{d Y}{d t} = f(Y, t, p(Y, t; \ldots);\ldots),
```
i.e. ordinary differential equations depending on state `Y`,
auxiliary functions of the state `p`, and other parameters
represented by the ellipses. For example, `p` may represent
the transpiration rate, which must be computed each time step
based on the vegetation prognostic state, functions of time,
like the atmosphere state, and other parameters.
Currently, only a simple plant hydraulics model is supported,
but our plan is to include much more complex representations
of the vegetation.
Addition of additional versions of vegetation
models requires defining a model type (of super type
`AbstractVegetationModel`), and extending the methods
imported by Models.jl, as needed, for computing the
right hand side functions of the ordinary differential equations
and the functions which update auxiliary variables whenever
the right hand side is evaluated.
This code base assumes that DifferentialEquations.jl
will be used for evolving the system in time,
and that the array-like objected being stepped forward
is a `ClimaCore.Fields.FieldVector`.
While a simple array may be sufficient for vegetation models,
the `FieldVector` type is used in order to make use of
`ClimaCore` functionality when solving PDEs (required for
other components of Land Surface Models) and for ease of
handling multi-column models.
To simulated land surfaces with multiple components (vegetation,
soil, rivers, etc), the ClimaLSM.jl package should be used.
That package will use the methods of this function for advancing
the system forward in time, extending methods as needed to account
for interactions between components.
