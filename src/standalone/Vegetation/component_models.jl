    AbstractCanopyComponent{FT <: AbstractFloat}

An abstract type for canopy component parameterizations.

Canopy component parameterizations do not run in standalone
mode, but only as part of a `CanopyModel`. As such, they
do not require all of the functionality of
`AbstractModel`s,  and they are not `AbstractModel`s
themselves. The `CanopyModel` is an `AbstractModel`.

However, some of the same functionality is nice to have
for canopy components, especially when defining the variables,
which is why we introduce the
`AbstractCanopyComponent` type and extend many of the
methods for `ClimaLand.AbstractModel`s for
the canopy component parameterizations.

Sets the spatially and temporally varying prescribed fields of the `component`

These fields are stored in the aux-state and *should not* depend on the prognostic
state `Y` or other diagnostic variables stored in `p`; this allows them
to be updated first, prior to updating the rest of the aux state and prognostic state.

However, there is no
guarantee on the order of operations in terms of when diagnostic auxiliary
variables are updated vs. prescribed field auxiliary variables; any required
order of operations must be enforced by the developer who writes the update_aux
function.
