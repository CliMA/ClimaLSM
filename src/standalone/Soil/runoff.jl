    AbstractRunoffModel

The abstract type for soil runoff models to be used with
the following boundary condition types:
- `ClimaLand.Soil.AtmosDrivenFluxBC`
- `ClimaLand.Soil.RichardsAtmosDrivenFluxBC`,

and for these functions:
-`ClimaLand.Soil.soil_surface_infiltration`
- `ClimaLand.Soil.subsurface_runoff_source`
- `ClimaLand.source!`.

Please see the documentation for these for more details.
The model should specify the subsurface runoff sink term as well
as the surface runoff implementation.

    NoRunoff <: AbstractRunoffModel

A concrete type of soil runoff model; the 
default choice which does not include the 
effects of runoff.

"""
    soil_surface_infiltration(::NoRunoff, net_water_flux, _...)

A function which computes the infiltration into the soil
 for the default of `NoRunoff`.

If `net_water_flux = P+E`, where `P` is the precipitation and `E`
is the evaporation (both negative if towards the soil), 
this returns `P+E` as the water boundary flux for the soil.

    subsurface_runoff_source(runoff::AbstractRunoffModel)::Union{Nothing, AbstractSoilSource} 

A function which returns the soil source for the runoff model 
`runoff`; the default returns nothing in which case no source is added.
