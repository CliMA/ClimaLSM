A default method which computes and returns the zero for the
derivative of the part of the
implicit tendency in the top layer, due to the boundary
condition, with respect to the state variable in the top layer.

For a diffusion equation like Richards equation with a single state
variable, this is given by
`∂T_N∂Y_N = [-∂/∂z(∂F_bc/∂Y_N)]_N`, where `N` indicates the top
layer cell index.

If `F_bc` can be approximated as independent of `Y_N`, the derivative
is zero.
