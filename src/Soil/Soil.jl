module Soil
#=
    Soil

This module contains everything needed to run a soil model
in standalone mode.

The soil model is assumed to have a set of prognostic `Y` and
auxiliary `p` variables, which describe the state of the
soil system. The system is evolved in time by solving 
equations of the form

```

\frac{\partial Y}{\partial t} = D(Y, t, p(Y, t; \ldots);\ldots),

```

i.e. partial (or ordinary) differential equations depending 
on state `Y`,
auxiliary functions of the state `p`, and other parameters 
represented by the ellipses. The operator `D` indicates a generic
nonlinear differential operator.  Not every model
requires auxilary variables, but these are useful for storing
quantities that are needed multiple times per right hand side
evaluation. An example would be the temperature, which is computed
from the prognostic variables of water content and internal
energy.

Currently, both the Richardson Richards Equation (RRE; hydrology alone)
and an integrated soil energy and hydrology model are supported.

Addition of additional versions of soil
models requires defining a model type (of super type 
`AbstractSoilModel`), and extending the methods
imported by Models.jl, as needed, for computing the
right hand side functions of the ordinary differential equations
and the functions which update auxiliary variables whenever
the right hand side is evaluated.

This code base assumes that DifferentialEquations.jl
will be used for evolving the system in time,
and that the array-like objected being stepped forward
is a `ClimaCore.Fields.FieldVector`. 

The `FieldVector` type is used in order to make use of 
`ClimaCore` functionality when solving PDEs (`ClimaCore` handles
all of the spatial discretization and operator functionality)
 and for ease of handling multi-column models.

To simulate land surfaces with multiple components (vegetation,
soil, rivers, etc), the ClimaLSM.jl package should be used.
That package will use the methods of this function for advancing
the system forward in time, extending methods as needed to account
for interactions between components.
