# # Introduction to the Land Bucket Model

# The land bucket model implemented in ClimaLSM is based off of
# the models of Manabe (1969)[1], Milly and Shmakin (2002)[2], and the SLIM
# model (Laguë, Bonan, Swann 2019)[3], with small changes, as noted.

# This tutorial explains in brief the core equations and the
# necessary parameters of the bucket model, and shows how to set up a simulation in standalone
# mode. More detail for coupled runs can be
# found in the ClimaCoupler.jl [documentation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCoupler.jl/dev/) and in the coupled simulation [tutorial](https://clima.github.io/ClimaLSM.jl/dev/generated/coupled_bucket/).

# At each coordinate point on the surface, we solve ordinary differential
# equations for the subsurface water storage
# of land (`W`, m), the snow water equivalent multiplied by the snow cover fraction (`σS`, m),
# and the surface water content of land (`Ws`, m).
# We additionally solve a partial differential equation for the land
# temperature as a function of depth (`T`, K). The snow cover fraction
# is given by a heaviside function in the current code.

# In what follows,
# surface fluxes over `soil` generally indicate fluxes
# over non-snow-covered
# regions. The exception
# is the albedo of vegetated and non-vegetated surfaces, for which
# we use the symbol `α_sfc`.

# We have:

# ``
# \frac{d W}{dt} = I,
# ``

# ``
# \frac{d Ws}{dt} = P_{liq} + σM - (1-σ) E_{soil} - I,
# ``

# ``
# \frac{d σS}{dt} = P_{snow} - σ(E_{snow} + M),
# ``

# ``
# ρc \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = κ_{soil} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
# ``

# ``
# F_{bot} = 0.0 = -κ_{soil} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}|_{z = z_{bot}}
# ``

# ``
# (1-σ) (R_n+ SHF + LHF)_{soil} + σG_{undersnow} = -κ_{soil} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}|_{z = z_{sfc}}
# ``

# ``
# G_{undersnow} = (R_n+ SHF + LHF)_{snow} - F_{intosnow}
# ``

# ``
# F_{intosnow} = -ρ_l L_{f,0} (M+E_{snow})
# ``


# ``
# R_n = -(1-α)*SW↓ -LW↓ + σ_{SB} T_{sfc}^4
# ``

# where the water fluxes are : `I` the infiltration as defined in [1], `P_liq` (m/s) the
# water volume flux of precipitation, `P_snow` (m/s) the water
# volume flux in the form of snow, `(1-σ)E_soil` (m/s) the water volume flux
# in evaporation,
# `σE_snow` the water volume flux in sublimation from snow, and
# `σM` (m/s) the water volume flux in melting of snow. The melt rate is
# defined via the net surface flux when surface temperatures are above freezing.

# For heat fluxes, we have `R_n` the net radiation, `SHF` the sensible
# heat flux, `LHF` the latent heat flux, `G_undersnow` the heat flux into snow-covered soil,
# and `F_intosnow` the heat flux into the snowpack itself. Note that the water balance
# equation for snow is equivalent to the heat balance
# equation, since we neglect the sensible heat contribution and only track the
# latent heat contribution.

# Finally, we have `α_sfc(lat, lon)` the
# (snow-free) surface albedo, `ρc` the volumetric
# heat capacity of the land, `σ_SB` the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,  and `κ_soil` the thermal
# conductivity. The albedo is a linear interpolation between the albedo of surface and
# snow, as decribed in [3]. The surface temperature is taken to be equal to the temperature
# T at the first grid point, assumed to be the same for soil and snow. At present the snow cover fraction is a heaviside function, and only one set
# of surface fluxes is computed per grid point.

# Turbulent surface fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and water vapor
# (`SHF, LHF, E`) are computed using Monin-Obukhov theory; `SW↓` and `LW↓`
# are the downward fluxes in short and long wavelength bands. We use the same
# roughness lengths for snow and soil.
# Note that with the exception of precipitation and downwelling radiation,
# all fluxes are defined
# such that positive is towards the atmosphere.

# As the temperature at the surface of the soil and snow is the same, only the evaporation
# changes between the two surface coverage types. We have

# ``
# E_{soil} =  β(W, W_f) E(q_{sat}(T_{sfc}, ρ_{sfc}; liquid),
# ``

# where β is the factor used in [1] which accounts for the fact that soil does not evaporate at the potential
# rate when it is not saturated. This makes use of the field
# capacity parameter `W_f`.
# We also have

# ``
# E_{snow} = E(q_{sat}(T_{sfc}, ρ_{sfc}; ice).
# ``

# # Simulating a standalone bucket model

# First, we need to import necessary packages. We use [SciMLBase.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBase.jl)
# and [ClimaTimeSteppers.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaTimeSteppers.jl) for the timestepping.
import SciMLBase
import ClimaTimeSteppers as CTS

# We use [ClimaCore](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCore.jl)
# for setting up the domain/coordinate points. While
# this infrastructure isn't really necessary for standalone simulations,
# adhering to it makes setting up coupled simulations very easy. It also
# is nice to rely on ClimaCore utilities because they have been designed
# in advance for running distributed simulations.
using ClimaCore

# We also use CLIMAParameters, which strives to ensure a common set of
# parameters across all Clima models, and to make parameter estimation
# more seamless.
import CLIMAParameters as CP

# We also use Insolation to calculate solar zenith angle and solar insolation.


# Lastly, let's bring in the bucket model types (from ClimaLSM) that we
# will need access to.

using ClimaLSM.Bucket: BucketModel, BucketModelParameters, BulkAlbedoFunction
using ClimaLSM.Domains: coordinates, Column
using ClimaLSM:
    initialize,
    make_update_aux,
    make_exp_tendency,
    make_set_initial_cache,
    PrescribedAtmosphere,
    PrescribedRadiativeFluxes
# We also want to plot the solution
using Plots

# And we need to use the DateTime type to store reference times
using Dates

FT = Float32;

# As mentioned we use CLIMAParameters for earth parameters that are
# required across models (e.g. the density of water and ice, the latent
# heat of fusion at a reference temperature, etc). The land model requires
# additional parameters as described in the text above. These two sets
# are combined in the object `BucketModelParameters` as follows:
import ClimaLSM
include(joinpath(pkgdir(ClimaLSM), "parameters", "create_parameters.jl"));
earth_param_set = create_lsm_parameters(FT);

# Define our `BulkAlbedoFunction` model using a constant surface and snow albedo:
# The surface albedo is a function of coordinates, which would be
# (x,y) on a plane, and (lat,lon) on a sphere. Another albedo
# option is to specify a `BulkAlbedoStatic` or `BulkAlbedoFunction`,
# which uses a NetCDF file to read in surface albedo.
# These options only applies when coordinates are (lat,lon).
α_sfc = (coordinate_point) -> 0.2;
α_snow = FT(0.8);
albedo = BulkAlbedoFunction(α_snow, α_sfc);
# The critical snow level setting the scale for when we interpolate between
# snow and surface albedo
σS_c = FT(0.2);
# The field capacity of the soil
W_f = FT(0.15);
# Roughness lengths (meters)
z_0m = FT(1e-2);
z_0b = FT(1e-3);
# Thermal parameters of soil
κ_soil = FT(0.7);
ρc_soil = FT(2e6);
# Snow melt timescale
τc = FT(3600);
# Simulation start time, end time, and timestep
t0 = 0.0;
tf = 7 * 86400;
Δt = 3600.0;

bucket_parameters = BucketModelParameters(
    κ_soil,
    ρc_soil,
    albedo,
    σS_c,
    W_f,
    z_0m,
    z_0b,
    τc,
    earth_param_set,
);

# Set up the model domain. At every surface coordinate point, we'll solve
# an ODE for `W` and `Ws`, and for every subsurface point, we solve for `T`.
# In coupled simulations run at the same
# resolution as the atmosphere, the bucket horizontal resolution would match the
# horizontal resolution at the lowest level of the atmosphere model. In general, however, the two
# resolutions do not need to match. Here we just set up something
# simple - a Column.

soil_depth = FT(3.5);
bucket_domain = Column(; zlim = (-soil_depth, FT(0.0)), nelements = 10);


# The PrescribedAtmosphere and PrescribedRadiation need to take in a reference
# time, the date of the start of the simulation. In this tutorial we will
# consider this January 1, 2005.
ref_time = DateTime(2005);

# To drive the system in standalone mode,
# the user must provide
# prescribed functions of time for the water volume flux in precipitation,
#  for the net downward shortwave and longwave
# radiative energy fluxes (`SW↓, LW↓`, W/m^2),
# for the atmospheric temperature `T_a`,
# wind speed `u_a` (m/s), specific humidity `q_a`, and air density
# `ρ_a` (kg/m^3) at a reference height `h_a` (m).

# Here we define the model drivers, starting with downward radiation.
SW_d = (t) -> 300;
LW_d = (t) -> 300;
bucket_rad = PrescribedRadiativeFluxes(FT, SW_d, LW_d, ref_time);

# Prescribed atmospheric variables

# Stochastic precipitation:
precip = (t) -> 0;
snow_precip = (t) -> 5e-7 * (t > 3 * 86400) * (t < 4 * 86400);
# Diurnal temperature variations:
T_atmos = (t) -> 275.0 + 5.0 * sin(2.0 * π * t / 86400 + 7200);
# Constant otherwise:
u_atmos = (t) -> 3.0;
q_atmos = (t) -> 0.005;
h_atmos = FT(2);
P_atmos = (t) -> 101325;
bucket_atmos = PrescribedAtmosphere(

    T_atmos,
    u_atmos,
    q_atmos,
    P_atmos,
    ref_time,
    h_atmos,

# Then, we create the model object, which contains the drivers, parameters,
# domain, and is associated with the correct differential equations
# for the bucket model:
model = BucketModel(
    parameters = bucket_parameters,
    domain = bucket_domain,
    atmosphere = bucket_atmos,
    radiation = bucket_rad,
);

# Note the holder structs for the radiation and atmosphere functions: they
# are named `Prescribed`. In coupled simulations, we would use a different
# type and rely on multiple dispatch to obtain the atmospheric and radiative
# quantitites from the coupler.

# Like all ClimaLSM models, we set up the state vector using `initialize`:
Y, p, coords = initialize(model);

# We can inspect the prognostic and auxiliary variables of the model:
ClimaLSM.prognostic_vars(model)
Y.bucket |> propertynames
# The auxiliary variables in this case are the surface temperature, the turbulent fluxes, the
# net radiation, and the surface specific humidity.
ClimaLSM.auxiliary_vars(model)
p.bucket |> propertynames


# Next is to set initial conditions.
Y.bucket.T .= FT(270);
Y.bucket.W .= FT(0.05);
Y.bucket.Ws .= FT(0.0);
Y.bucket.σS .= FT(0.08);

# We also set the initial values of the cache here:
set_initial_cache! = make_set_initial_cache(model);
set_initial_cache!(p, Y, t0);

# Then to create the entire right hand side (tendency) function for the system
# of ordinary differential equations:
exp_tendency! = make_exp_tendency(model);

# Now we choose our timestepping algorithm.
timestepper = CTS.RK4()
ode_algo = CTS.ExplicitAlgorithm(timestepper)

# Then we can set up the simulation and solve it:
prob = SciMLBase.ODEProblem(
    CTS.ClimaODEFunction(T_exp! = exp_tendency!, dss! = ClimaLSM.dss!),
    Y,
    (t0, tf),
    p,
);

# We need a callback to get and store the auxiliary fields, as they
# are not stored by default.
saveat = collect(t0:Δt:tf);
saved_values = (;
    t = Array{Float64}(undef, length(saveat)),
    saveval = Array{NamedTuple}(undef, length(saveat)),
);

cb = ClimaLSM.NonInterpSavingCallback(saved_values, saveat);

sol = SciMLBase.solve(prob, ode_algo; dt = Δt, saveat = saveat, callback = cb);

# Extracting the solution from what is returned by the ODE.jl commands
# is a bit clunky right now, but we are working on hiding some of this.
# `parent` extracts the underlying data from the ClimaCore.Fields.Field object
# and we loop over the solution `sol` because of how the data is stored
